**Encapsulation**
This restricts direct access into the Student Class's data and allows controlled access through getter and setter methods.
**Method Overloading**
By using method overloading it allows multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters
multiply(int a, int b) multiplies two intergers
multiply(int a, int b, int c) multiplies three intergers
**Method Overriding**
This enables the subclass Dog and Subclass Cat to overide the method makeSound() from class Animal and modifying the method results in Dog barking and Cat meowing.
**Abstraction**
This allows defining the abstraction class Appliance that constain abstract method turn on() which are then implemented by the subclasses Fan and TV with specific functionality resultin in the Fan and TV turning on.
**Exception Handling**
This ensures that errors such as dividing the zero does not cause the program to crash
The try block reads two numbers and performs division and if the second number is 0, an ArithmeticException occurs.
